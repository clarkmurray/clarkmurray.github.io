			<p>My name is Clark Murray, and I am a student in the F17 Cohort of Awesome Inc. U's Web Developer Bootcamp. I was born and raised in Lexington, Kentucky, graduating from Bryan Station High School in 2012 and from Transylvania University in 2016 with a degree in Philosophy, Politics &amp; Economics (PPE). After graduating, I worked for a year as a healthcare claims processor at Conduent, Inc. (formerly Xerox) and as a court records researcher conducting background checks before deciding to pursue a career in coding.</p>
			<p>My hobbies include reading, playing basketball, playing video games, obsessing over UK basketball and football, going down the Wikipedia rabbit hole, and arguing that Batman can in fact beat Superman in a fight.</p>
